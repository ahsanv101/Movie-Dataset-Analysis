# Movie-Dataset-Analysis


## Introduction:
This project will try to gain some insights on movies from the dataset of movies we obtained
from grouplens.org and TMBD. We will be trying to answer some broader questions like what
are common features within movies, how does budget play role, how does popularity come into
account etc. We will then final try to predict the revenue of a movie based on the rest of its
features

## Who:
This dataset was collected from TMBD which is a popular database for movies. A major chunk
of this dataset also comes from Grouplens, which is a social computing research lab.

## Need:
Primarily, this data was collected so that an exploratory data analysis can be carried out narrate
story and the history of cinema throughout time
We will look at impact of actors and directors on movies.
We are going to also analyze the impact of budget and genre on revenue
We will look at different movies of franchises comparing it to movies that donâ€™t belong to any
franchise
We will look at popularity and voting of movies and try to contrast it with its success
Will try to get insights on the best time period for a movie to be released
We will also try to test whether longer running time movies are successful or not
We will test some other hypothesis as well like about Walt Disney studio
Through this dataset it is also possible to predict movie revenue/success as well as a classifier for
letting us know whether a movie will generate a profit or loss.
